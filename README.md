## Quasistatic imports

Quasistatic imports are things that happen only very rarely -- for example, coastline changes, landmass changes, country borders, etc.

## Dynamic imports

Dynamic imports are things that change much more frequently -- for example, buildings, addresses, points of interest, and even things like roads.
